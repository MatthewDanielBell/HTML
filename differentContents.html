  <h1>Flow Content</h1> 
  
  <small>Small <b>text</b>!</small>  And <q>text</q> is bold text.
  
  <br>
  <strong>Strong <b>text</b>!</strong> Here <q>text</q> is bold text as well, but it doesn't show over the strong emphasis.
  
  <br>
  The following is an example of a block quote; taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote
  <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
     <p>Flow content typically contain text or embedded content.</p>

  <h1>Heading content</h1>
  It looks like there is 1-6 different headers based off emphasis. Both of the past two headers are "1" but I'll change the next few headers.
  
  <br>
  <section>
    <h6>Sectioning content (header 6)</h6>
    Sectioning content create sections, tough concept. This header and text was in it's own section compared to the rest of the document.
	<br>
	And I believe is to allow for scope of variables?
	<br>
	Oh, and that h6 header is <small>tiny!</small>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Phrasing content(header 5)</h5>
    I believe it is to allow for modification of the paragraph block? But apparently it can also modify the mark-up as well.

  <section>
    <h4>Embeded Content(header4)</h4>
	Imported content; such as images and audio.
